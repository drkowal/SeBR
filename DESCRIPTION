Description: Monte Carlo and MCMC sampling algorithms for
    semiparametric Bayesian regression analysis. These models
    feature a nonparametric (unknown) transformation of the data
    paired with widely-used regression models including 
    linear regression, spline regression, quantile regression,
    and Gaussian processes. The transformation enables broader
    applicability of these key models, including for real-valued,
    positive, and compactly-supported data with challenging 
    distributional features. The samplers prioritize computational
    scalability and, for most cases, Monte Carlo (not MCMC)
    sampling for greater efficiency.
